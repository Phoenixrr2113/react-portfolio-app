									Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of

									It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds,
									simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them
									to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited.
									Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds.
									Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as
									makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in
									the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that
									the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that
									any people you may meet from time to time are merely the
									products of a deranged imagination.

									bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states
									that this has already happened.
